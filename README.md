# Global EV & Lithium Transition Modeling

This repository provides forecasting models and scenario simulations for analyzing the future of electric vehicle (EV) adoption and global lithium supply. It supports researchers, analysts, and policymakers working on sustainable mobility and energy transitions.

## Project Structure

| Notebook | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `EVS_Forecast.ipynb` | Forecasts global annual electric vehicle sales (in millions). |
| `Global_Lithium_Production_Forecast.ipynb` | Projects global lithium production trends to evaluate supply readiness. |
| `Scenareos_Analysis.ipynb` | Performs scenario-based analysis on EV and lithium transition impacts. |
| `Test_EVS.ipynb` | Unit tests and validation for the EV forecasting model. |
| `Test_Global_Lithium_Production_Forecast.ipynb` | Tests and validates lithium production forecasting logic. |
| `Test_Scenareos_Analysis.ipynb` | Validates scenario simulation assumptions and output stability. |

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages:


## Usage

Run the notebooks using Jupyter:


Each notebook is self-contained and includes:
- Data loading
- Forecast modeling
- Visualization outputs

## Testing

Use the `Test_*.ipynb` notebooks to validate forecast logic, ensure consistent outputs, and catch edge case issues.

## Sample Visuals

Visual outputs in the notebooks include:
- EV sales projections under multiple policy scenarios
- Lithium production vs. demand curves
- Scenario impact comparisons
